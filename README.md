# Towards Autonomous Drones with Ultra-wideband
This is the official git repo to Ilian Jaeger's master thesis "Towards Autonomous Drones with Ultra-wideband". It contains the acquired measurement data, the python scripts for simulating trilateration and generating plots, as well as a wiki where all important things for future students are explained:
- How to use the drone I built
- How to build a drone yourself
- How to use my code
- How to take measurements and how to evaluate them

The report of this thesis can also be found on this repo.
